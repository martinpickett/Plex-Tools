# Plex Meta Manager (PMM)

This directory contains files for use with [Plex Meta Manager](https://github.com/meisnate12/Plex-Meta-Manager) which I use to wrangle my plex libraries.

There are a small number of movie posters used for Plex Collections included in this repository, I have done my best to provide links to the artist and where I found the poster.

To understand some of the files in this directory, you need to understand my Plex library setup. I have two "Films" libraries:
	- Films
	- Films (Home)
They are almost identical, however "Films (Home)" includes 4K HDR films, which "Films" does not. The reason for this divide is that I share "Films" with other Plex users, but my upload speed is not sufficient to stream 4K HDR films. So I use "Films (Home)" and everyone else uses "Films".
