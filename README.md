# Plex Tools

This repository contains a collection of tools I use to interact with Plex Media Server.
- Plex Meta Manager configuration files
- plex-required-bitrate.py script


[Plex Meta Manager](https://github.com/meisnate12/Plex-Meta-Manager) allows you to wrangle a Plex library by modifying metadata and building custom collections. My custom configuration files can be found here.

plex-required-bitrate.py is a Python3 script which calculates the upload bitrate required to stream the video track from a video file for different client buffer sizes.

### Note
There are a small number of movie posters used for Plex Collections included in this repository, I have done my best to provide links to the artist and where I found the poster. If the artist has issue with either their inclusion or my attribution please open an issue and I will rectify the situation.
